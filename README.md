Repository showcasing my Python coding ability for finance applications.
*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
PLEASE NOTE
I have chosen to protect my python code by removing key components of the code. This is to prevent anyone from taking my code and using it, without my permission.
Additionally, I have private Github repositories with python models that serve the purpose of advanced financial analysis and algorythmic trading, which I can 
demonstrate to potential employers, upon request.
